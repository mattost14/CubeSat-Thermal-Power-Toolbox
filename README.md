# CubeSat Thermal Power App

On this MATLAB app (GUI) you can:
1) Propagate Earth/Moon orbit;
2) Model your CubeSat by selecting its size, surface materials and properties, deployable solar panels, and internal thermal resistances;
3) Compute the generated solar power, power consumption, and power budget;
4) Compute the thermal loads and nodes temperatures using a simple lumped thermal capacity model;
